## Audio A-Law converter

Sinatra application that takes WMA encoded files as input and converts them to A-Law WAV files with a background loop mixed in (unless the filename contains "-msg", "msg-" or "message-").

Depends on SoX and mplayer system packages (easily installed with Homebrew on a Mac OS X).
Also depends on the Mac OS X system voice 'Audrey' (installable through System Preferences / Text to Speech).
